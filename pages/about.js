                <p style={{ marginBottom: '50px' }}>
                Arizona Cool deck resurfacing is a specialized art. If the cool deck replacement is not mixed perfectly the bonding that needs to take place will not occur. The precise mixture that has to be used is a combination of the additive and aggregate combined just right that will allow the bonding to take place and will last for many years. Because temperature and humidity levels change through out the year, the mixture will change. Our employees have been doing this most of their lives and have mastered the art of concrete adhesion. Our 3 year warranties are the longest in the industry. When we restore your pool deck you can expect the craftmanship will last for many years beyond the warranty.
